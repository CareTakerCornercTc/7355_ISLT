        <p class="subheading"> Introduction to Healthcare Policies</p> <br> 

        <p> It is quite possible that you have not read or even know what your loved one has for health insurance.  
            I know that you are dealing with a lot of emotions right now but it is important that you find out what 
            health insurance coverage or coverages they have because it will help determine what types of care they 
            qualify for under the terms of their policies. 
        </p> <br> 
        <p> It will also contain duration of treatment types, medications that may or may not covered, 
            preauthorization for certain treatments and other important details.  You should make a copy of the 
            policy.  Try to always have handy the policy number, the patientâ€™s name, birthday and social security 
            number as well as a copy of a patient authorization to discuss the policy. The 3 common types of health 
            insurance are Medicare, Private Insurance and Medicaid.  Below is a video discussing Medicare Benefits 
            as an example of information that can be found on the internet for healthcare policy information.

        <h2>Benefits: Other Types of Coverage</h2><br>
        <p class="subheading"> Introduction to Other Types of Benefits</p><br>

        <p>Another thing that you might not be aware of is that in these circumstances, your loved one 
          may have other benefits or insurance coverage that can assist with their needs in this time of crisis.  
          For example, if your loved one is a veteran or the spouse of a veteran, they may be entitled to certain 
            veteran benefits such as Aid & Attendance.</p> <br>
          <p>It is possible that they are covered under long term disability insurance that 
          may cover some of the potential costs to care for them.  Hopefully, you know where this 
              information is or that your loved one can communicate it to you.</p> <br>
          
          <p>If not, take a deep breath, remain calm and begin looking for the information.  Remember, 
              it is possible that there is no other coverage.  </p> <br>

      <h2 class="Living Arrangements">Types of Living Arrangements</h2><br>
          
       <p class="subheading">What Is Safe Now?</p><br>
          
       <p> In this new reality, living arrangements may happen in several different stages before a more permanent placement occurs.  
            For example, a stroke victim may stay full-time temporarily at a rehabilitation center (which is usually part of a nursing home) 
            but a separate building or floor. Once rehabilitation is completed based on the insurance coverage, a decision will be made as to 
           where the stroke victim will be placed.  </p> <br>
            
      <p>  If they cannot care for themselves, they must have a suitable person care for them or be placed in a nursing home/facility that can accommodate their needs.  
            The level of care at the nursing home depends on the level of their disability or how well they can take care of themselves.  If they cannot prepare their 
            own meals, shower, go to the bathroom without help, or take medications, then they would be placed in the highest level of care which is skilled 
            nursing.  If they can take care of some of their basic needs then they may be placed in unskilled nursing which means that they are somewhat independent and able to meet some of their own basic needs 
            without help.</p> <br>
